Harmonies Bulk Upgrade HOWTO by Samyaza

1. On your PS3, open multiMAN.
2. Open C3 CON Tools, Setlist Manager -> File -> Scan PS3 to Create Setlist, then wait for it to finish scanning and generating your setlist.
3. Go to the C3 CON Tools folder, then the "bin" folder, and copy PS3_DATA_LIST.csv onto a flash drive or something.
4. Boot into a Linux distribution of your choice. I used Ubuntu, which is probably your best bet if you've never used one before.
5. Go to https://github.com/FujiSkunk/rbhp/, click the green "clone or download" button on the upper right, and choose "Download ZIP". 
6. Boot into a Linux distribution of your choice. I used Ubuntu, which is probably your best bet if you've never used one before.
7. Download https://github.com/a...h22/make_npdatathe same way you did for RBHP. 
8. Extract it, open the "Linux" folder, right-click on an empty space in the folder, and choose to open a command prompt there.
9. Type "make" in the command prompt, and wait for it to finish compiling.
10. Open c3ps3tool.pl in your editor of choice and change the settings. The main ones you should need are "my $ip", which you should change to your PS3's IP in multiMAN, and "my $npdataPath", which you should change to wherever you put the compiled make_npdata.
11. Open a command prompt in your c3ps3tool directory and type "./setup.sh". It'll install the Perl modules the script needs.
12. Put your PS3_DATA_LIST.csv file and the "rbhp-master" folder in the same folder as c3ps3tool.
13. Type "./c3ps3tool.pl --dtalist PS3_DTA_LIST.csv --search /rbhp/" in the command prompt, then wait for it to finish.
14. Enjoy your harmonies upgrades!
